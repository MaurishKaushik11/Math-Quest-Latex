\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.4$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0.2$, find $P(A|B)$.
    \item A bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Find the probability that the second ball is red given that the first ball was blue.
    \item In a class of 40 students, 25 study Math and 20 study Physics. If 10 study both, find the probability that a student studies Physics given they study Math.
    \item If $P(A) = 0.6$, $P(B|A) = 0.7$, find $P(A \cap B)$.
    \item A card is drawn from a deck. Let $A$ be the event that it is a king and $B$ the event that it is a spade. Find $P(A|B)$.
    \item The probability that a person likes tea is $0.7$, coffee is $0.5$, and both is $0.3$. Find $P(\text{Tea}|\text{Coffee})$.
    \item In a factory, 80\% of items are of high quality and 20\% are defective. If a high-quality item passes inspection with probability 0.95 and a defective item passes with probability 0.2, find the probability that an item is high-quality given it passed inspection.
    \item A die is rolled twice. Find the probability that the sum is 9 given that the first roll was a 4.
